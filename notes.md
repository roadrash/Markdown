# One for main heading

Usually it is best to keep the main heading as the first line of the documents so that it can be easily parsed out of the file.

Usually best to only have a single main heading per document.

## Two for secondary heading

Main division of content within a given document.

### Three for third level

Really the smallest heading that is practical in most cases.

#### Fourth level (but don't use this)

Not easily distinguishable by most renderers. By the way, *never* use headings for formatting

##### Fifth level (but don't use)

###### Sixth level (but don't use)
