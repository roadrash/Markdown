# headings is a block

This is a paragraph that can have multiple lines in it. Still the same paragraph.

Here comes an "unordered list":

- A thing
  - a subthing 
- Another thing
- Yet another thing

Here is an "ordered list":

1. One
    1. One.One
2. Two
3. Three
4. Four

Here is a code fence:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
echo hello world
```

~~~md
```sh
#!/bin/sh
echo hello world
```
~~~

But what about blocks that just start with spaces?

    This is some verbatim code.
    :)
    Hello.

Hello.
